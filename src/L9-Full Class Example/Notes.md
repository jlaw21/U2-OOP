## Full Class Example

This example walks through creating a `BankAccount` class, which will simulate a user's bank account. 

First, we map out the class. However, or whatever form, you want this to take, sketch out what attributes and methods the class will contain.

What are the characteristics or attributes of a bank account?

* <write answers here>

Sketch in the getters and setters for each attribute. There is a cool trick that IntelliJ will do this for you.

What are the behaviors of a bank account? 

* <write answers here>

What constructors might we need?

* <write answers here>

Any other methods we want to write?

* <write answers here>

With the class sketched out, we can now code it in. **ALWAYS** plan before you type.
